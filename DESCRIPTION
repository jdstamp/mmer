Description: The Multimodal Marginal Epistasis (MME) Test is a statistical
    method which detects marginal epistatic variants. It focuses the 
    scans for epistasis to regions of the genome that have known functional 
    enrichment for a trait of interest. The test fits a linear mixed model
    which corrects for population structure. The software implements a novel 
    statistical algorithm that allows MME perform genome-wide testing of 
    marginal epistasis in human biobank-scale data.
