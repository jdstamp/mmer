\usage{
simulate_traits(
  plink_file,
  output_file,
  additive_heritability,
  gxg_heritability,
  additive_indices,
  gxg_indices_1,
  gxg_indices_2,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{plink_file}{Character. Path to the PLINK dataset (without file extension).
The function will append \code{.bed}, \code{.bim}, and \code{.fam} extensions as needed.}

\item{output_file}{Character. Path to the output file where the simulated trait will be saved.}

\item{additive_heritability}{Numeric. A value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion
of trait variance due to additive genetic effects.}

\item{gxg_heritability}{Numeric. A value between 0 and 1 specifying the proportion
of trait variance due to gene-by-gene (epistatic) interactions. The sum of
\code{additive_heritability} and \code{gxg_heritability} must not exceed 1.}

\item{additive_indices}{Integer vector. Indices of SNPs contributing to additive genetic effects.}

\item{gxg_indices_1}{Integer vector. Indices of SNPs in the first group for epistatic interactions.}

\item{gxg_indices_2}{Integer vector. Indices of SNPs in the second group for epistatic interactions.}

\item{log_level}{Character. Logging level for messages (e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING"). Default is "WARNING".}
}
\value{
None. The simulated trait is written to the specified \code{output_file}.
}
\description{
This function simulates a quantitative trait based on additive and epistatic
genetic effects using genotype data from a PLINK dataset. The simulated trait
is saved to a specified output file in a phenotype format compatible with PLINK.
}
\details{
The function uses the following components to simulate the trait:
\itemize{
\item Additive genetic effects: Determined by \code{additive_indices} and the specified \code{additive_heritability}.
\item Epistatic interactions: Simulated using pairs of SNPs from \code{gxg_indices_1} and \code{gxg_indices_2},
contributing to the \code{gxg_heritability}.
\item Environmental effects: Any remaining variance not explained by genetic effects is assigned
to random environmental noise.
}

The output file is in PLINK-compatible phenotype format with three columns:
Family ID (\code{FID}), Individual ID (\code{IID}), and the simulated trait (\code{TRAIT}).
