\arguments{
\item{plink_file}{Character. File path to the PLINK dataset (without *.bed extension).
The function will append \code{.bim}, \code{.bed}, and \code{.fam} extensions automatically.}

\item{pheno_file}{Character. File path to a phenotype file in PLINK format.
The file should contain exactly one phenotype column.}

\item{mask_file}{Character or NULL. File path to an HDF5 file specifying per-SNP
masks for gene-by-gene interaction tests. This file informs which SNPs are tested
for marginal epistasis. Defaults to \code{NULL}, indicating no masking.
Masking impacts the scaling of memory and time.}

\item{gxg_indices}{Integer vector or NULL. List of indices corresponding to SNPs to test for marginal epistasis.
If \code{NULL}, all SNPs in the dataset will be tested. These indices are \strong{1-based}.}

\item{chunk_size}{Integer or NULL. Number of SNPs processed per chunk. This influences memory
usage and can be left \code{NULL} to automatically determine the chunk size based on \code{gxg_indices} and number of threads.}

\item{n_randvecs}{Integer. Number of random vectors used for stochastic trace estimation.
Higher values yield more accurate estimates but increase computational cost. Default is 10.}

\item{n_blocks}{Integer. Number of blocks into which SNPs are divided for processing.
This parameter affects memory requirements. Default is 100.}

\item{n_threads}{Integer. Number of threads for OpenMP parallel processing. Default is 1.}

\item{gxg_h5_group}{Character. Name of the HDF5 group within the mask file containing gene-by-gene
interaction masks. SNPs in this group will be included in the gene-by-gene interactions. Defaults to "gxg".}

\item{ld_h5_group}{Character. Name of the HDF5 group within the mask file containing linkage disequilibrium
masks. SNPs in this group are excluded from analysis. Defaults to "ld".}

\item{rand_seed}{Integer. Seed for random vector generation. If \code{-1}, no seed is set. Default is -1.}

\item{log_level}{Character. Logging level for messages. Must be in uppercase (e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO",
"WARNING", "ERROR"). Default is "WARNING".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{summary}: A tibble summarizing results for each tested SNP, including:
\itemize{
\item \code{id}: Variant ID.
\item \code{index}: Index of the SNP in the dataset.
\item \code{chromosome}: Chromosome number.
\item \code{position}: Genomic position of the SNP.
\item \code{p}: P value for the gene-by-gene interaction test.
\item \code{pve}: Proportion of variance explained (PVE) by gene-by-gene interactions.
\item \code{vc}: Variance component estimate.
\item \code{se}: Standard error of the variance component.
}
\item \code{pve}: A long-format tibble of PVE for all variance components.
\item \code{vc_estimate}: A long-format tibble of variance component estimates.
\item \code{vc_se}: A long-format tibble of standard errors for variance components.
\item \code{average_duration}: Average computation time per SNP.
}

\description{
MME tests for marginal epistasis by incorporating functional data to inform
the gene-by-gene interaction covariance matrix for computational and statistical
efficiency.
}
\details{
This function integrates PLINK-formatted genotype and phenotype data to perform
marginal epistasis tests on a set of SNPs. Using stochastic trace estimation,
the method computes variance components for gene-by-gene interaction and genetic
relatedness using the MQS estimator. The process is parallelized using OpenMP
when \code{n_threads > 1}.

The memory requirements and computation time scaling can be optimized through
the parameters \code{chunk_size}, \code{n_randvecs}, and \code{n_blocks}.

\strong{Mask Format Requirements}

The mask file format is an HDF5 file used for storing index data for
the masking process. This format supports data retrieval by index.
Below are the required groups and datasets within the HDF5 file:

The required group names can be configured as input parameters.
The defaults are described below.
\itemize{
\item \strong{Groups}:
\itemize{
\item \code{ld}: Stores linkage disequilibrium blocks for each focal SNP.
\item \code{gxg}: Stores indices of SNPs that are grouped for interaction or epistatic analysis.
}
\item \strong{Datasets}:
\itemize{
\item \verb{ld/<j>}: For each focal SNP \verb{<j>}, this dataset contains indices of SNPs in the same LD block of
that SNP.
\item \verb{gxg/<j>}: For each focal SNP \verb{<j>}, this dataset contains indices of SNPs to include in the
test for marginal epistasis with focal SNP \verb{<j>}.
}
}

\strong{Important}: All indices in the mask file data are \strong{zero-based}, matching the zero-based indices of the PLINK \code{.bim} file.
