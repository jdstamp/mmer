# mmer - The Multimodal Marginal Epistasis test R implementation <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="200" alt="" />


<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `mmer` package implements a computationally and statistically efficient method for detecting marginal epistasis in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). 
Find the full package documentation including examples and articles here: [Multimodal Marginal Epistasis test Documentation](https://jdstamp.github.io/mmer/).

The method builds on

- the Marginal Epistasis Test (MAPIT)
- the multivariate Marginal Epistasis Test (mvMAPIT) 

The package documentation for these methods including examples and articles can be found here: [Multivariate MAPIT Documentation](https://lcrawlab.github.io/mvMAPIT/).

## Key Features

-	Stochastic Trace Estimation: Enables computational speedup to scale to Biobank scale data.
-	Multimodal Input: Incorporates prior data from HDF5 files to improve power in detecting gene-by-gene interactions.
-	Optimize for Memory Constraints: Parameters like chunk size, number of random vectors, and number of blocks allow to optimize for low memory constraints or fast computation.
-	Parallelization: Utilizes OpenMP for efficient multi-threaded processing.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mmer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jdstamp/mmer")
```

## Dependencies

The full list of R dependencies can be found in the [DESCRIPTION file](https://github.com/jdstamp/mmer/blob/main/DESCRIPTION).

This package depends on several C++ libraries to provide efficient functionality and performance. 
Make sure the following software are installed and available on your system:

1. HDF5 - A file format and set of tools for managing complex data.
2. Boost - A collection of portable C++ libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library.
3. OpenMP - A standard API for parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran.

The package ships with the header-only HDF55 C++ library [HighFive](https://github.com/BlueBrain/HighFive).
This package utilizes the  library for efficient and index based access to masking data. HighFive is a modern C++11 header-only library that provides a user-friendly interface for reading, writing, and managing data in HDF5 format.
