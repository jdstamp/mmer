# mmer - The Multimodal Marginal Epistasis test R implementation <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="200" alt="" />


<!-- badges: start -->

The `mmer` package implements a computationally efficient method for detecting marginal epistasis in genome-wide association studies (GWAS).

## Installation

You can install the development version of mmer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jdstamp/mmer")
```

## Key Features

-	Stochastic Trace Estimation: Enables computational speedup to scale to Biobank scale data.
-	Multimodal Input: Incorporates prior data from HDF5 files to improve power in detecting gene-by-gene interactions.
-	Optimize for Memory Constraints: Parameters like chunk size, number of random vectors, and number of blocks allow to optimize for low memory constraints or fast computation.
-	Parallelization: Utilizes OpenMP for efficient multi-threaded processing.

## Dependencies

### HighFive

This package utilizes the [HighFive](https://github.com/BlueBrain/HighFive) library for efficient and index based access to masking data. HighFive is a modern C++11 header-only library that provides a user-friendly interface for reading, writing, and managing data in HDF5 format.

HighFive was chosen for its:

-	Ease of use: Provides an intuitive API for interacting with complex HDF5 datasets.
-	Performance: Offers efficient handling of large-scale data without compromising on speed.
-	Modern C++ support: Fully utilizes C++11 features, making it compatible with modern C++ applications.

In this package, HighFive is used to read SNP specific masking data by accessing it by index.
